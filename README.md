Kaushal XChange is an innovative skill exchange application built using Kotlin in Android Studio, designed to revolutionize how people learn and share knowledge. It provides a unique platform where users can teach what they know and learn what they aspire to — through a smart, community-driven exchange system.

The app features an Explore Skill section, where users can browse through various available skills, access structured learning modules, and study high-quality notes and materials. Each skill is divided into comprehensive modules that include concise explanations and interactive quizzes. After completing all modules, users can take an integrated test to verify their proficiency.

When a user likes a particular skill, it gets added to My Learning Wishlist, reflecting the subjects they wish to learn. Upon successfully passing the assessment for any skill, it is automatically listed under Skill I Can Teach, signifying the user’s eligibility to guide others in that domain.

Kaushal XChange’s most powerful feature is its Skill Matching Engine, which intelligently compares users’ teaching and learning preferences. It identifies matches where one user’s teaching skill aligns with another’s learning interest — and vice versa. When a match is found, users can send a teach request directly through the app. The receiving user gets an instant notification, and if they accept, the skill session is activated and added to Active Courses.

Within Active Courses, Kaushal XChange integrates an in-app Jitsi video calling interface, enabling seamless one-on-one live learning sessions. After completing a course, learners can take a post-assessment to verify their understanding. Once passed, the skill is moved to the Acquired Skills section, completing the full learning cycle.

Kaushal XChange also supports chat-based mentorship and aims to create opportunities for income through personalized teaching sessions and expert guidance. With a focus on practical learning, collaboration, and verified assessments, it ensures that every user evolves as both a learner and a teacher.

The application’s UI is smooth, modern, and highly responsive, offering a delightful experience with an intuitive layout, clean transitions, and a professional appearance. Kaushal XChange stands as a complete ecosystem for learning, teaching, and sharing — empowering individuals to grow through knowledge exchange at their fingertips.
